### Short version

NIME is dedicated to a harassment-free conference experience for everyone. Our code of conduct can be found at: 
[http://www.nime.org/code-of-conduct](http://www.nime.org/code-of-conduct).

### Long version

NIME is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of all ethnicities, countries of origin, gender identities and expressions, ages, abilities, religions, sexual orientations, physical appearances, body sizes, economic backgrounds, scholarly or professional backgrounds, employment, religions, and other differences.

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Harassment is unwelcome conduct that reinforces social structures of domination. This conduct encompasses a broad range of behaviours, and might take the form of verbal commentary (directly to, or about others), bullying, deliberate intimidation, sexually suggestive images, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome sexual attention.

By attending the NIME conference you are agreeing to this code of conduct at all conference venues and conference-related social events. The policy extends equally to exhibitors, vendors, and other attendees. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.

If you are being harassed, noticed that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of the conference staff immediately. Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.
