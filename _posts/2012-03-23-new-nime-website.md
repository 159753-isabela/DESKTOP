It is a real pleasure for us to unveil this new NIME website. It has been a great effort from the Steering Committee to provide a whole new web experience for materials related to the International Conference on New Interfaces for Musical Expression. One significant improvement is the archiving and indexing of all the proceedings, that we hope will bring an easier way for all of you to find and cite NIME papers. The platform that we have now installed is expected to grow with more services: photos, videos, special pages, etc. If you have any questions or requests, feel free to comment on this post or send an email to the [Steering Committee](http://www.nime.org/committee/).
