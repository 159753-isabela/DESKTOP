# nime-website-concept

A New Concept for the NIME Website

To hack on this you'll need to clone it, and install [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) following these instructions.

From memory:

1. go into the nime-website-concept repo.
2. `bundle install`
3. `bundle exec jekyll serve`

## Plans and Problems:

- Serving on GitHub pages won't work as the max website there is 1GB.
- Actually how big is the NIME archive?
- Anyway, get used to hosting somewhere else, but that's ok because you get more flexibility with useful Jekyll Plugins.
- Ideally, we will have a CI workflow set up so that it publishes on push.
